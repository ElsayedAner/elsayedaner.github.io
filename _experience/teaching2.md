        As a dedicated Assistant lecturer at the Faculty of Engineering, <a href="http://www.eru.edu.eg/" target="_blank">Egyptian Russian University (ERU)</a>, I had the privilege of contributing to the academic growth and development of students. My role encompassed a diverse range of responsibilities, including assisting professors during lectures, conducting tutorials, and providing one-on-one guidance to students. I facilitated engaging discussions, clarified complex concepts, and encouraged critical thinking. My commitment extended beyond the classroomâ€”I actively participated in curriculum development, designed practical experiments, and mentored students in research projects. Through my interactions with aspiring engineers, I fostered a passion for learning, instilled confidence, and helped shape the next generation of professionals. It was a rewarding journey marked by collaboration, knowledge sharing, and a genuine desire to ignite curiosity within our students.
